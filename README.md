# ONLINE-TIMER

This is my "second" personal experiment in creating a multiuser/multiplayer application. Now with Node server and Java client.

The main use for this is to connect two (or more) persons at same time to they share an online/virtual chronometer. This should work as a practice station which brings the players to a new level of speedcubing practicing.
